# Introduction
This project aims to perform data preparation and initial analysis on a real estate dataset. The dataset includes information about properties from both sales and rental listings, sourced from various sources. The goal is to gain insights into the characteristics of the real estate market and prepare the data for further analysis or modeling.

### **Project Steps**

1. Data Loading and Inspection
   - **Data Collection**: Real estate data is collected from multiple sources, including online listings and databases.
   - **Initial Inspection**: The structure and basic characteristics of the dataset are examined, including the number of records, columns, and data types.


2. Data Preprocessing
   - **Duplicate Data Removal**: Any duplicate records in the dataset are identified and removed to ensure data integrity.
   - **Data Type Identification**: The data types of columns are determined, and appropriate conversions are made if necessary.
   - **Missing Data Handling**: Missing values in the dataset are addressed through imputation or removal, depending on the context.
   - **Outlier Detection**: Outliers in the data, which may skew analysis results, are identified and processed using statistical methods.
   - **Feature Engineering**: New features are created based on existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the dataset.


3. Data Analysis and Exploration
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Relationships between different variables in the dataset are explored using correlation matrices and visualizations.
   - **Distribution Analysis**: The distribution of key variables, such as price and area, is examined to understand their patterns and characteristics.
   - **Visualization**: Various plots and charts are created to visualize the data and gain insights into underlying trends and patterns.


4. Data Modeling Preparation
   - **Feature Selection**: Relevant features for modeling are selected based on their importance and contribution to the target variable.
   - **Data Splitting**: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.


5. Conclusion
   - This project serves as a foundational step in the analysis of real estate data. By preparing the dataset and performing initial exploratory analysis, it sets the stage for further analysis or modeling tasks. The insights gained from this project can be used by stakeholders in the real estate industry for decision-making and strategic planning.
